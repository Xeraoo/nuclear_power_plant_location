# "Nuclear Power Plant Location"

## Overview

This project uses spatial analysis in QGIS to identify optimal locations for a nuclear power plant in the Pomorskie Voivodeship (Poland). Multiple geographical, environmental, and socio-economic factors were analyzed to determine suitable areas based on criteria such as proximity to lakes, parks, energy infrastructure, unemployment rates, and elevation.

## Maps and Analysis

### 1. **Lakes Located in the Pomorskie Voivodeship**
   - **Description**: A map showing the distribution of lakes within the Pomorskie Voivodeship.
   - **Purpose**: To analyze the proximity of large water bodies that could potentially serve as cooling sources for a nuclear power plant.

### 2. **Lakes Larger Than 8 kmÂ²**
   - **Description**: This map highlights lakes exceeding an area of 8 square kilometers.
   - **Purpose**: Identifies large lakes that could be more suitable for industrial use.

### 3. **Lakes Outside National Parks and Their Buffers**
   - **Description**: A map showing lakes located outside national parks and their protective zones.
   - **Purpose**: To avoid environmental restrictions that would complicate the development of a nuclear power plant.

### 4. **Lakes Located Within 8 km of Energy Transmission Lines**
   - **Description**: Highlights lakes that are within 8 kilometers of existing energy transmission lines.
   - **Purpose**: Proximity to existing energy infrastructure is critical for cost-effective connection to the power grid.

### 5. **Lakes in Areas With Unemployment Rates Above 8%**
   - **Description**: Displays areas where the unemployment rate exceeds 8%.
   - **Purpose**: Prioritizing areas with higher unemployment rates can contribute to local economic development.

### 6. **Lakes in Areas Above 100 Meters Above Sea Level**
   - **Description**: Identifies lakes located in areas with an elevation exceeding 100 meters above sea level.
   - **Purpose**: Elevation is important for flood risk management and other geological considerations.

## Legend
The legend provides the following symbols and color coding for map interpretation:
- **Lakes**: Blue
- **Parks and Their Buffers**: Red outlines
- **Energy Transmission Lines (110 kV)**: Pink
- **Unemployment Rate > 8%**: Pink areas
- **Elevation Above 100 Meters**: Orange areas

## Tools and Software

- **QGIS**: All spatial data analysis and map production were done using QGIS, a free and open-source Geographic Information System.
- **Geospatial Data**: Data on lakes, parks, elevation, unemployment rates, and energy infrastructure were used to create these maps.
